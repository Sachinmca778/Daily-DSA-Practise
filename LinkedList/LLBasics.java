//Linked List
1.A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are connected using pointers. 
2.Each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.
3. Linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation and are particularly useful for cases where the size of the data changes frequently.


// Types of Linked Lists
1. Singly Linked List: Each node has a data field and a reference to the next node.
2. Doubly Linked List: Each node has a data field and references to both the next and previous nodes.
3. Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.


// Advantages of Linked Lists
1. Dynamic size: Linked lists can grow or shrink in size as needed.
2. Efficient insertion and deletion: Adding or removing elements from a linked list is faster than an array.
3. No need for contiguous memory: Linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, unlike arrays.


// Disadvantages of Linked Lists
1. Slower access time: Accessing elements in a linked list is slower than in an array due to the need to traverse the list.
2. Extra memory: Linked lists require additional memory for storing references to the next node.
3. No random access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not support random access to elements based on an index.


//Basic Stucture of Linked List
Data: The value stored in the node.
Next: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

//Implementing a Singly Linked List in Java

class Node {
    int data; // Value stored in the node
    Node next; // Pointer to the next node

    // Constructor to initialize the node
    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
